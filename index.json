We propose a novel, one-shot point cloud simplification method which preserves both the salient structural features and the overall shape of a point cloud without any prior surface reconstruction step. Our method employs Gaussian processes suitable for functions defined on Riemannian manifolds, allowing us to model the surface variation function across any given point cloud. A simplified version of the original cloud is obtained by sequentially selecting points using a greedy sparsification scheme. The selection criterion used for this scheme ensures that the simplified cloud best represents the surface variation of the original point cloud. We evaluate our method on several benchmark and self-acquired point clouds, compare it to a range of existing methods, demonstrate its application in downstream tasks of registration and surface reconstruction, and show that our method is competitive both in terms of empirical performance and computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/stutipathak5/gps-for-point-clouds.","tags":[],"title":"GP-PCS: One-shot Feature-Preserving Point Cloud Simplification with Gaussian Processes on Riemannian Manifolds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan de Boi","Stuti Pathak","Marina Oliveira","Rudi Penne"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1701043200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701043200,"objectID":"1191acb343bec437a4d3f2972c18f2a5","permalink":"https://stutipathak5.github.io/publication/conference-paper-copy/","publishdate":"2023-11-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/conference-paper-copy/","section":"publication","summary":"Camera calibration is a first and fundamental step in various computer vision applications. Despite being an active field of research, Zhang's method remains widely used for camera calibration due to its implementation in popular toolboxes like MATLAB and OpenCV. However, this method initially assumes a pinhole model with oversimplified distortion models. In this work, we propose a novel approach that involves a pre-processing step to remove distortions from images by means of Gaussian processes.\nOur method does not need to assume any distortion model and can be applied to severely warped images, even in the case of multiple distortion sources, e.g., a fisheye image of a curved mirror reflection. The Gaussian processes capture all distortions and camera imperfections, resulting in virtual images as though taken by an ideal pinhole camera with square pixels. Furthermore, this ideal GP-camera only needs one image of a square grid calibration pattern.\nThis model allows for a serious upgrade of many algorithms and applications that are designed in a pure projective geometry setting but with a performance that is very sensitive to non-linear lens distortions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by simplifying Zhang's calibration method, reducing the number of parameters and getting rid of the distortion parameters and iterative optimization. We validate by means of synthetic data and real world images. The contributions of this work include the construction of a virtual ideal pinhole camera using Gaussian processes, a simplified calibration method and lens distortion removal.","tags":[],"title":"How to turn your camera into a perfect pinhole model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1619481600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1619481600,"objectID":"c8f11c5b1eae80dae6dbed6e60181966","permalink":"https://stutipathak5.github.io/project/external-project-copy-2/","publishdate":"2021-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/external-project-copy-2/","section":"project","summary":"The mechanical properties characteristic of any composite plate were identified in frequency as well as time domain using two types of neural networks: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN).","tags":["Demo"],"title":"Machine Learning Assisted System Identification of a Composite Plate","type":"project"},{"authors":["Stuti Pathak","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
